about=This plugin has been developed to help in the decision of locating a mobile command center (MCC) after a major incident has taken place. A MCC is used to get a central location for decision making and logistics on site close to the incident. This location serves as a rendezvous point and offer service facilities for the emergency workers as well as an extended arm for the decision makers which often are located far from the incident.
